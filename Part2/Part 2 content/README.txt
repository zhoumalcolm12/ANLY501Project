	    This file contains code for getting basic statistical results from input
	    datasets (mean/median/standard deviation/quantiles/outliers)
	    This file also explores the correlations between pairs in weather information
	    and generate histograms/scatter plots/heat maps/box plots for visualization
	
    Input File:
        output.csv
	    This file contains the top 30 airports in the U.S. and is used to passed
	    as parameters in collect_departed.py to generate the raw outputs
	    This file contains the combination of the aircraft information and weather 
	    information of all the airlines from three raw datasets
	
    Report File:
        Statistical Analysis Report.docx
	    Report that explains the procedures and results of basic statisitical 
	    analysis and data cleaning results. This report also explores the correlation
	    and provides insights on the results generated by different statistical approaches

==============================================================================================
Association Rule Part:
    Python Files:
	associate rule.py 
	    Python code using Apyori 1.1.1.
	anotherpackage.py
	    Python code using mlxtend.	

    Output File:
	arr_0.01.txt
	arr_0.05.txt
	arr_0.005.txt
	dep_0.01.txt
	dep_0.05.txt
	dep_0.005.txt
    	    
	The above 6 text files areoutcomes of association rules considering arrival delay and 	    			departure delay with min_support=0.01,0.05,0.005 using the Apyori 1.1.1 Python package.

	mlxtend_arr_5.csv
	mlxtend_arr_6.csv
	mlxtend_dep_5.csv
	mlxtend_dep_6.csv

	The above 4 csv files are the outcomes of association rules and frequent itemsets by using 			mlxtend Python package. the 5 and 6 mean the length of the itemsets, arr/dep means the type
	of delay.

    Report File:
	Association Rules.docx 
	    Report part and cleaned_data.csv is the cleaned data for association rules.

==============================================================================================
Clustering Part:
    Python Files:
	clustering.py 
	    Python document for 501 project clustering part: read in data and process ward,k-	    means,dbscan clustering analysis and PCA plot graphs.
        clustering_insights.py
            python code for clustering insights, using flight altitude, flight speed and departure delay attributes
    Input File:
        cleandata.csv
	    Input data for clustering.py 
        df_ml_wo_weather
            input file of clustering_insights.py

==============================================================================================
Hypothesis testing part:
     Input Files:
            cleandata.csv: 
                  input file of hypothesis_testing.py
     Python File:
            hypothesis_testing.py
	          Python code for hypothesis testing

==============================================================================================
Machine Learning Part:
    Input Files:
	data_1.csv
	    Input data for weather_match_clean.py
	    This is part of collected and cleaned data frome Project part 1 
	    and served as input file for this part.

	data_2.csv
	    Input data for weather_match_clean.py
	    This is part of collected and cleaned data frome Project part 1 
	    and served as input file for this part.

	data_3.csv
	    Input data for weather_match_clean.py
	    This is part of collected and cleaned data frome Project part 1 
	    and served as input file for this part.

	weather.csv
	    Input data for weather_match_clean.py
	    This is part of collected weather data frome Project part 1 
	    and served as input file for this part.

    Python Files:
	weather_match_clean.py
	    This pythos file input data_1.csv, data_2.csv, data_3.csv, and weather.csv
	    It concatenate three flight data files and match corresponding weather data.
	    Further clean for missing and incorrect values are performed in this file.
	    It output: cleaned_data.csv

	machine_learning_binaryclass.py
	    This python file reads in cleaned_data.csv
	    It creats binary delay type data. Using different classifiers to predict
	    departure or arrival delay. There is an option to choose whether
	    to include weather data or not.
	    Logistic regression, and Recursive Feature Elemination is implmented.
	    k-folds cross-validation during traning, accuracy socre, confusion matrices,
	    testing report, and ROC curves are generated.

	machine_learning_multiclass.py
	    This python file reads in cleaned_data.csv
	    It creats multi-type delay level data. Using different classifiers to predict
	    departure or arrival delay level. There is an option to choose whether
	    to include weather data or not.
	    k-folds cross-validation during traning, accuracy socre, confusion matrices,
	    testing report, and multi-type class ROC curves are generated.
