Python Files (Python):
    Analysis Part (Python\Collection):
    Analysis.py
	This file contains code for getting basic statistical results from input
	datasets (mean/median/standard deviation/quantiles/outliers)
	This file also explores the correlations between pairs in weather information
	and generate histograms/scatter plots/heat maps/box plots for visualization
	

Input File
    output.csv
	This file contains the top 30 airports in the U.S. and is used to passed
	as parameters in collect_departed.py to generate the raw outputs
	This file contains the combination of the aircraft information and weather 
	information of all the airlines from three raw datasets
	
	
  
Report File
    Statistical Analysis Report.docx
	Report that explains the procedures and results of basic statisitical 
	analysis and data cleaning results. This report also explores the correlation
	and provides insights on the results generated by different statistical approaches
