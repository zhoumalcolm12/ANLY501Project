# ANLY 501 Project
<h3> Flight Delay Analysis </h3>
<br> • Gathered a large volume of flight dataset using API and web scraping, and performed data cleaning and clustering </br>
<br> • Conducted network analysis, and created a machine learning-based application to determine delay rate using Python </br>
